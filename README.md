# Combinatorial auction: slides

This repo contains the code for generating slides covering the topic of **combinatarial auctions**, done as part of the course [20602-Algorithms](https://didattica.unibocconi.it/ts/tsn_anteprima.php?cod_ins=20602&anno=2021&IdPag=6352) at Bocconi University.
You can find a Julia implementation of the proposed models here [github.com/andreateruzzi/combinatorial_auction_ILP](https://github.com/andreateruzzi/combinatorial_auction_ILP).

## Branches

- In the main branch, you can find the code for reproducing the slides.
- In the [pdf branch](https://github.com/andreateruzzi/combinatorial-auction/tree/pdf), you can find an updated deck of slides in pdf format.
- In the [presentation branch](https://github.com/andreateruzzi/combinatorial-auction/tree/presentation), you can find a more fragmented version of the slides used for presentation purposes, which includes more "breaks" and "pauses".
